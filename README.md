# blender_donut_and_coffee

Turning a simple torus into a delicious [3D donut](https://www.youtube.com/user/AndrewPPrice/videos) with [Blender 2.8](https://www.blender.org), a free and open 3D creation suite.

Below, the donut is rendered using cycles and a denoising filter (removes graininess). Looks pretty delicious if you ask me:
